	    <h3>Analysis of Presidential Approval Factors</h3>
	    <p><a href="STA 104 Project.pdf">PDF for Project</a></p>
	    <p>In this project, I looked into three questions of interest: </p>
	    <ol>
		    <li>Is there a significant difference in GDP (per billion of dollars) between democratic and republican presidents?</li>
		    <li>Which two quarters have the greatest difference in approval ratings?</li>
		    <li>Is an increase in GDP positively associated with higher presidential approval ratings?</li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>To answer the first question, I used   a two sample permutation test with alpha = 0.05, to find the difference in GDP between democratic 
		    and republican presidents. I conclude that there is enough evidence
		    to say that when the president from the democratic party, the GDP is significantly larger than when 
		    the president is republican.</p>
	    <p>To answer the second question of which quarter has the strongest association with approval ratings, I used 
		    the permutation F-test with alpha = 0.05 to find if there was a difference in means of approval ratings within the quarters and and 
		    conclude that there is not enough evidence to conclude that not all approval ratings in each quarter are equal. To check if there 
		    are differences between quarters, I applied Tukey HSD permutation test which shows that there is no significant difference of 
		    approval ratings between the four quarters. All quarters have approximately the same approval ratings.</p>
	    <p>To see if higher GDP is positively correlated to higher presidential approval ratings, I assigned GDP as the predictor 
		    variable and approval rating as the response. I first found the Pearson's correlation coefficient. As GDP decreases,
		    presidential approval decreases too. The Kendall's tau permutation test was used because it was not based on normality
		    assumption of approval ratings.  It implies almost no association, so pairs are equally likely to be discordant or 
		    concordant. Therefore, GDP has no association with presidential approval ratings. </p>
