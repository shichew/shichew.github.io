	    <h3>Forecasting US Average Prescription Costs</h3>
	    <p><a href="STA 137 Project.pdf">PDF for Project</a></p>
	    <p>We analyzed a data set containing data about the monthly U.S. average prescription
		    cost in dollars from August 1986 to March 1992. We applied a transformation of the data 
		    with a natural log transformation to stabilize the variance. It was determined that there is a yearly seasonal 
		    component from the pattern in the data that occurs every year. To remove the trend in this data, 
		    we fit a second degree polynomial to the data, then used the sum of harmonics was used to remove seasonality. 
		    We then applied the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm to select the best model using the AIC criteria. The 
		    resulting model that the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm selected was AR(1). After fitting a model, we forecasted 
		    the next 10 months of U.S. average prescription cost in dollars.</p>
