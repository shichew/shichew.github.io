	    <h3>Estimating Probabilities of Success & Analyzing Dependencies Between Variables</h3>
	    <p><a href="STA 138 Project 2.pdf">pdf for Estimating Probabilities of Success & Analyzing Dependencies Between Variables</a></p>
	    <ul>
		    <li>Estimating Probabilities of Success</li>
		    <p>In this dataset, we had three nominal variables about patients with a particular condition. We estimated the probability 
			    of a successful treatment overall, between group probability of success, and between year probability of success, and determined 
			    that the relationship between the group and success.
			    We concluded that treatment does not depend on the year or the group for it to be successful. </p>
		    <li>Analyzing Dependencies Between Variables</li>
		    <p>We analyzed the dependencies between gender and death type of people in horror films by using Pearsonâ€™s test for independence. 
		    Then to test how different female and male deaths were for each death type, we used a confidence interval for difference in proportions in 
		    gender for each death type. We concluded that blunt force trauma and stabbing are independent of gender, but females die slightly more 
		    often in other circumstances not listed and males die by getting shot slightly more than females do.</p>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <h3>Logistic Regression & Log-Linear Models</h3>
	    <p><a href="STA 138 Project 1.pdf">pdf for Logistic Regression & Log-Linear Models</a></p>
	    <ul>
		    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
		    <p>For customers who came into a car dealership, We explored the relationship between if they bought a car and the age of the current car 
			    using logistic regression. We concluded that there is an influence on age of currently owned car on the odds of buying a car.</p>
		    <li>Log-Linear Models</li>
		    <p>Using log-linear models, we examined the dependence of the variables: age (young, old), gender(male, female), IQ(high, low). We used model
			    selection with the AIC criteria to fit a model to our data, then tested whether we can drop the terms. We determined if each 
			    interaction term has an effect by using the Wald confidence intervals for the interaction terms. We concluded that age and gender
			    were independent but age and IQ are dependent.</p>
