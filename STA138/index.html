		    <p>For this project, we analyzed the dependencies between gender and death type of people in horror films by using Pearsonâ€™s test for independence. 
		    Then to test how different female and male deaths were for each death type, we used a confidence interval for difference in proportions in 
		    gender for each death type. We concluded that blunt force trauma and stabbing are independent of gender, but females die slightly more 
		    often in other circumstances not listed and males die by getting shot slightly more than females do.</p>
